Simply Pitchforks adds a new tool to the game: pitchforks.

A pitchfork is crafted by placing the materials in a + shape in the crafting table, as such:

 M
M|M
 |
 
The two vertical lines represent sticks, which are constant in each pitchfork recipe. The M is what changes.

Pitchforks can be made with the same materials as any other tool: wood, cobblestone, iron, gold, and diamonds. The only difference is that wooden pitchforks are crafted using sticks instead of wood planks! That means the recipe for a wooden pitchfork consists of 5 sticks in a + shape.

Pitchforks are used mainly as a farming tool, although they are just as good as an axe when it comes to fighting. Hold a pitchfork in your hand and right-click on a fully grown crop to harvest it and replant a seed in one action, increasing how many seeds you get from a crop as well as reducing the time required to harvest and replant a field.
